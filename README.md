Welcome to the Board Game Rules Explainer Github repository. This was a group project for the [Full Stack Deep Learning 2022 Course](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/2022/). 

We are a team of four members: [Rafał](https://github.com/rafaljanwojcik), [Tim](https://github.com/timjones1), [Issam](https://github.com/quig) & [Muriel](https://github.com/murielhol)

The aim of this project was to build and deploy a Question Answering system to reduce the amount of time players spend reading and checking the rulebook while playing board games. 

The project makes extensive use of the Haystack open source library and this repository was forked from the main [Haystack repository](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) which is awesome.



our project presentation slides are available [here:](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CkBQa9E5Id5zUBW_zXxb4WnwfLJhqKw0aU0tbRD4txQ/edit?usp=sharing)
